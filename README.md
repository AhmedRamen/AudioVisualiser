# AudioVisualee (Audio Visualiser)
### By Ahmed Abdul Rahman

The main objective of an audio visualiser is to play music while visualising the sound in an oscilloscope.

AudioVisualee is a (WIP) media player written in SDL that visualises music via many different visualisers. Albeit this is labelled as a C program, majority is taken via Timidity, libmodplug, and SDL Sound.
